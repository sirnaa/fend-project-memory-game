## Instructions

This project is made for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Course from Udacity's starter code. 

To get started, open the `index.html` in any web browser and open the game. 

The goal of the game is to find card pairs that match. Time and moves count, but do not affect the end of the game.

The game ends when all card pairs are matched! 

## Built with
